This Repo contains all the codes of the questions I have submitted on different online judges like codechef,spoj,etc.

The codes may not be efficient and many of them are solved through brute force. It is recommended that everyone try solving the question themselves and not copy the codes. You can refer them if you need to generate testcases or want to find out about a special case. 

P.S - IIIT OJ codes will only be uploaded once the deadline is over.
